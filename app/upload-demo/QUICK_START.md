## Tips

1. **For project-dependent tables** (drawings, submissions, invoices, etc.):
   - Include "Job Number" column in your data to auto-resolve project_id
   - OR select a project from the dropdown to apply to all rows

2. **Dates**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-05-13)

3. **Numbers**: Will be automatically converted (can be strings in CSV/JSON)

4. **Empty values**: Treated as null for optional fields

5. **Errors**: Check the results section for row-level error details

## Troubleshooting

- **"project_id is required"**: Add "Job Number" column or select a project
- **"Invalid JSON format"**: Check your JSON syntax
- **"Validation failed"**: Review required columns and data types
- **"Insert failed"**: Check for foreign key constraints or RLS policies
