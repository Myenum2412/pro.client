# ✅ Payment Status Update Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

After successful payment, the system now:
1. ✅ Saves payment record to `payments` table
2. ✅ Updates invoice `status` to `"Paid"`
3. ✅ Sets `paid_date` to current timestamp
4. ✅ Shows updated status in billing table

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Payment Verification Route (`app/api/payments/verify/route.ts`)

#### Before:
```typescript
// Payment verified successfully
// TODO: Update invoice status in database
// TODO: Create payment record

return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  paymentId: razorpay_payment_id,
});
```

#### After:
```typescript
// 1. Create payment record
await supabase.from("payments").insert({
  invoice_id: invoiceId,
  razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_signature,
  amount: amount || 0,
  currency: "INR",
  status: "success",
});

// 2. Update invoice status to "Paid"
await supabase.from("invoices").update({
  status: "Paid",
  paid_date: new Date().toISOString(),
}).eq("id", invoiceId);

return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  message: "Payment verified and invoice updated successfully",
});
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a permanent payment record with Razorpay transaction details
- Updates invoice status from "Draft"/"Pending" to "Paid"
- Records the exact date and time payment was made
- Triggers the `update_invoices_updated_at` trigger automatically

---

### 2. Pay Now Button (`components/billing/pay-now-button.tsx`)

#### Before:
```typescript
const verifyResult = await verifyPayment.mutateAsync({
  razorpay_order_id: response.razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_payment_id: response.razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_signature: response.razorpay_signature,
});
```

#### After:
```typescript
const verifyResult = await verifyPayment.mutateAsync({
  razorpay_order_id: response.razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_payment_id: response.razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_signature: response.razorpay_signature,
  invoiceId: invoice.id,              // ✅ Added
  amount: invoice.totalAmountBilled,  // ✅ Added
});

if (verifyResult.success) {
  alert("Payment successful! Invoice has been marked as Paid.\nPayment ID: " + verifyResult.paymentId);
  window.location.reload(); // Refresh to show updated status
}
```

**What it does:**
- Sends invoice ID and amount to verification endpoint
- Shows confirmation message that invoice is marked as paid
- Reloads page to display updated invoice status

## 📊 Database Schema Used

### Invoices Table Fields Updated:
```sql
status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Draft'::text 
  CHECK (status IN ('Paid', 'Pending', 'Overdue', 'Draft', 'Cancelled'))
  
paid_date timestamp with time zone NULL

-- Automatically updates this field via trigger:
updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
```

### Payments Table Record Created:
```sql
INSERT INTO payments (
  invoice_id,              -- Links to invoice
  razorpay_payment_id,     -- Razorpay transaction ID
  razorpay_order_id,       -- Razorpay order ID
  razorpay_signature,      -- Security signature
  amount,                  -- Payment amount
  currency,                -- INR
  status                   -- 'success'
)
```

---

## 🎯 Complete Payment Flow

```
1. User clicks "Pay Now" in drawer
   ↓
2. Drawer closes
   ↓
3. Razorpay opens
   ↓
4. User enters payment details
   ↓
5. User completes payment
   ↓
6. Razorpay verifies payment
   ↓
7. Handler sends verification to /api/payments/verify
   ↓
8. Server verifies signature (security check)
   ↓
9. ✅ INSERT into payments table
   ↓
10. ✅ UPDATE invoices SET status='Paid', paid_date=NOW()
    ↓
11. ✅ UPDATE invoices SET updated_at=NOW() (via trigger)
    ↓
12. Success response sent to client
    ↓
13. Success alert shown to user
    ↓
14. Page reloads
    ↓
15. ✅ Table shows "✓ Paid" instead of "Pay Now" button
```

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before Payment:
```
Invoice Table:
INV-1001  $2,475  [Pay Now] ← Green button
```

### After Payment:
```
Invoice Table:
INV-1001  $2,475  ✓ Paid ← Green checkmark text

Invoice Details:
Status: Paid ✅
Paid Date: Dec 23, 2025
Payment History:
  - $2,475 via Razorpay
  - Transaction: pay_xxxxx
  - Date: Dec 23, 2025
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Payment Signature Verification:
```typescript
// Generate signature from order and payment IDs
const secret = process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET;
const text = `${razorpay_order_id}|${razorpay_payment_id}`;
const generatedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update(text)
  .digest("hex");

// Compare with Razorpay's signature
if (generatedSignature !== razorpay_signature) {
  // REJECT - Possible tampering
  return error;
}
// ACCEPT - Signature valid, payment genuine
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents fake payment confirmations
- Ensures payment actually went through Razorpay
- Protects against malicious requests

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Complete Payment Flow:

1. **Setup Razorpay Test Mode:**
   ```env
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxx
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxx
   ```

2. **Open Billing Page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/billing
   ```

3. **Find Unpaid Invoice:**
   - Look for invoice with "Pay Now" button
   - Note invoice number (e.g., INV-1001)

4. **Start Payment:**
   - Click "Pay Now" → Drawer opens
   - Click "Pay Now" in drawer → Razorpay opens

5. **Complete Payment:**
   ```
   Mobile: 9876543210
   Click Continue
   Select "Cards" tab
   Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   CVV: 123
   Expiry: 12/25
   Click "Pay"
   ```

6. **Verify Success:**
   - ✅ See success alert with payment ID
   - ✅ Page reloads automatically
   - ✅ Invoice now shows "✓ Paid"
   - ✅ "Pay Now" button is gone

7. **Verify Database (Supabase Dashboard):**
   ```sql
   -- Check invoice status updated
   SELECT id, invoice_id, status, paid_date, updated_at
   FROM invoices
   WHERE invoice_id = 'INV-1001';
   
   -- Expected:
   -- status: 'Paid'
   -- paid_date: '2025-12-23 12:34:56'
   -- updated_at: '2025-12-23 12:34:56'
   
   -- Check payment record created
   SELECT * FROM payments
   WHERE invoice_id = (
     SELECT id FROM invoices WHERE invoice_id = 'INV-1001'
   );
   
   -- Expected: 1 record with razorpay details
   ```

---

## 📋 Database Triggers

### Auto-Update Timestamp Trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_invoices_updated_at 
BEFORE UPDATE ON invoices 
FOR EACH ROW 
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically sets `updated_at = NOW()` on every invoice update
- No need to manually set this field in code
- Tracks when invoice was last modified

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback (status changes)
- ✅ Clear payment confirmation
- ✅ Payment history tracked
- ✅ Can't accidentally pay twice (button disappears)

### For Business:
- ✅ Accurate payment records
- ✅ Automatic status tracking
- ✅ Audit trail (created_at, updated_at, paid_date)
- ✅ Reconciliation with Razorpay

### For Developers:
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Database consistency
- ✅ Easy to extend (add email, webhooks, etc.)

## 🔄 What Happens on Failure?

### If Payment Record Insert Fails:
```typescript
if (paymentError) {
  console.error("Error saving payment:", paymentError);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Payment verified but failed to save to database" },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```
- Payment IS verified by Razorpay (money received)
- But record not saved to database
- Error returned to client
- **Manual intervention needed to reconcile**

### If Invoice Update Fails:
```typescript
if (invoiceError) {
  console.error("Error updating invoice status:", invoiceError);
  // Don't return error - payment is already saved
}
```
- Payment record IS saved
- Invoice status NOT updated
- **Payment exists, can be reconciled later**
- No error shown to user (payment succeeded)
