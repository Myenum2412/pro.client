## 🚨 Critical Issue: Razorpay Not Working

### The Problem
When you click "Pay Now" button, you get error:
```
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

### Why It Happens
The Razorpay credentials are missing or incorrect in your `.env.local` file, so the API returns an HTML error page instead of JSON.

### The Solution (Takes 5 Minutes)

#### Step 1: Get Razorpay Credentials

1. **Go to Razorpay Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/
   - Create account or login

2. **Enable Test Mode:**
   - Look for "Test Mode" toggle in top-right
   - Make sure it's ON (you'll see "Test Mode" badge)

3. **Get API Keys:**
   - Go to: Settings → API Keys (or https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/keys)
   - Click "Generate Test Keys" if you don't have them
   - You'll see:
     - **Key ID**: Starts with `rzp_test_`
     - **Key Secret**: Click "Show" to reveal it

#### Step 2: Update `.env.local`

Open `C:\Users\najas\OneDrive\Desktop\client-dash\.env.local` and add:

```env
# Razorpay Payment Gateway (Test Mode)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Replace the `xxxxx` with your actual credentials from Step 1!**

#### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
# In your terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the server
# Then restart it:
npm run dev
```

#### Step 4: Test Payment

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/billing
2. Click "View Details" on any invoice
3. Click "Pay Now" button
4. Razorpay checkout should open (test mode)

**Use Test Card:**
```
Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
CVV: Any 3 digits
Expiry: Any future date
```

## ⚠️ Additional Fix Needed: Save Payment to Database

Currently, payment verification works but **doesn't save to database**.

### File to Update
`app/api/payments/verify/route.ts` (Lines 38-43)

### Current Code (TODO Comments)
```typescript
// Payment verified successfully
// Here you would typically:
// 1. Update invoice status in database
// 2. Create payment record
// 3. Send confirmation email
// etc.
```

### What to Add

Replace lines 38-50 with:

```typescript
// Payment verified successfully - Save to Supabase
const supabase = await createSupabaseServerClient();

// Extract invoice details from Razorpay order receipt
const receiptParts = body.receipt?.split('_') || [];
const invoiceNo = receiptParts[1] || '';

// Get invoice by number to get ID and amount
const { data: invoice } = await supabase
  .from('invoices')
  .select('id, total_amount_billed')
  .eq('invoice_id', invoiceNo)
  .single();

if (!invoice) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Invoice not found" },
    { status: 404 }
  );
}

// Create payment record
const { error: paymentError } = await supabase
  .from('payments')
  .insert({
    invoice_id: invoice.id,
    razorpay_payment_id,
    razorpay_order_id,
    razorpay_signature,
    amount: invoice.total_amount_billed,
    currency: "INR",
    status: "success",
  });

if (paymentError) {
  console.error("Error saving payment:", paymentError);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Payment verified but failed to save to database" },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}

// Update invoice status to Paid
const { error: invoiceError } = await supabase
  .from('invoices')
  .update({
    status: "Paid",
    paid_date: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('id', invoice.id);

if (invoiceError) {
  console.error("Error updating invoice:", invoiceError);
}

return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  paymentId: razorpay_payment_id,
  orderId: razorpay_order_id,
  message: "Payment verified and saved successfully",
});
```

### Add Import at Top of File

Add this after other imports:

```typescript
import { createSupabaseServerClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Before You Start
- [ ] Supabase project URL and keys in `.env.local`
- [ ] Database migrations run (001, 002, 003)
- [ ] Seed data inserted (check Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] Dev server running (`npm run dev`)

### After Razorpay Setup
- [ ] Can open billing page without errors
- [ ] Can click "View Details" on invoice
- [ ] Can click "Pay Now" button (Razorpay opens)
- [ ] Can complete test payment
- [ ] Payment record appears in `payments` table (Supabase)
- [ ] Invoice status updates to "Paid"

### Data Verification

**In Supabase Dashboard (Table Editor):**

```sql
-- Check projects (should have 3)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;

-- Check drawings (should have 56 total)
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drawing_log) as drawing_log,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drawings_yet_to_release) as yet_to_release,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drawings_yet_to_return) as yet_to_return;

-- Check invoices (should have 4)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;

-- Check submissions (should have 5)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions;

-- Check material lists (should have 2)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM material_lists;

-- Check payments (will be 0 until you make a test payment)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments;
```

**Expected Counts:**
- projects: 3
- drawing_log: 28
- drawings_yet_to_release: 16
- drawings_yet_to_return: 12
- invoices: 4
- submissions: 5
- material_lists: 2
- payments: 0 (until first payment)

---

## 🎯 Quick Start Command

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything:

```sql
-- Verification Query
SELECT 
  'projects' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM projects
UNION ALL
SELECT 'drawing_log', COUNT(*) FROM drawing_log
UNION ALL
SELECT 'drawings_yet_to_release', COUNT(*) FROM drawings_yet_to_release
UNION ALL
SELECT 'drawings_yet_to_return', COUNT(*) FROM drawings_yet_to_return
UNION ALL
SELECT 'invoices', COUNT(*) FROM invoices
UNION ALL
SELECT 'payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments
UNION ALL
SELECT 'submissions', COUNT(*) FROM submissions
UNION ALL
SELECT 'material_lists', COUNT(*) FROM material_lists
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
table_name                | count
-------------------------+-------
drawing_log              |    28
drawings_yet_to_release  |    16
drawings_yet_to_return   |    12
invoices                 |     4
material_lists           |     2
payments                 |     0
projects                 |     3
submissions              |     5
```
